# Travel App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

The **Travel App** is designed to help users explore travel destinations, plan trips, and discover new places. It leverages Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to offer a smooth and responsive experience. You can visit the live app at [Travel App](https://travel-app-priyank.netlify.app/).

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```

Then, run the development server:

# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

### Editing Pages
